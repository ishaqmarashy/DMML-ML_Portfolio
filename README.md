# F20DL Group 6 Portfolio (Collaborative work)

## This file explains the directories in this repository.

There are 2 main folders: Lab and CW.

### CW folder consists of 4 files:

1. Part 1: Exploration of the traffic sign dataset, including an analysis of feature distribution, target classes, and various image preprocessing techniques. Implementation of predictive Bayesian models with performance metrics in image classification.
   
3. Part 2: Includes image preprocessing such as thresholding and feature normalization. Implementation of clustering models with performance metrics like silhouette score in image classification. Feature reduction using T-SNE and PCA.
   
5. Part 3: Implementation of decision tree models with performance metrics in image classification and tree visualization.
   
7. Part 4: Covering linear classification models, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Extensive exploration of different structures and automated hyper-parameter searching with a comparison of model performance metrics. Feature reduction using T-SNE and PCA. Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Lab Folder consists of 7 Labs:

1. Lab 1: Dataset Exploration on 3 datasets (Spotify Top Hit Playlist (2010-2022), Water Quality and Potability, and MNIST).
   
2. Lab 2: Data Exploration & Visualization on previous 3 datasets by generating graphs.
   
3. Lab 3: Selected Spotify dataset and applied Feature Reduction and PCA.
   
4. Lab 4: Explored an image dataset called JMuBEN2 (Arabica coffee plantation leaves), applied pre-processing and normalization, trained a CNN model with 50 epochs and an SGD Classifier, and performed Evaluation Metrics on both models.
   
5. Lab 5: Trained different types of Na√Øve Bayes Classifiers on the dataset, and recorded Evaluation Metrics.
    
6. Lab 7: Different types of Clustering techniques were used on the dataset, and Evaluation Metrics were recorded, and clusters were plotted.
    
7. Lab 11: Used different structures of CNN Classifiers on the healthy/unhealthy leaf dataset, and recorded evaluation metrics.
